This weekend alone, Elon Musk's SpaceX is scheduled to release two satellites. And that is just one single company. He's also founder and CEO of Tesla and of Neuralink. It's safe to say Musk is a successful dude - and it starts along with his morning routine.

After getting six hours of sleep, the very first thing the billionaire does when he wakes up at 7 a.m. is certainly address what he calls "critical emails" for around 30 minutes.

He drinks coffee, but most mornings he's as well busy for breakfast.

Next, the 45-time good old entrepreneur and tech icon says goodbye to his five sons (from his first matrimony) and sends them off to college.

Then Musk includes a shower and drives to do the job. His mornings there usually are spent in engineering and design discussions, he says.

This is Musk's day to day routine, according to an interview with jobs website Glassdoor. The website recently ranked employees' beloved CEOs and Musk emerged in eight place with a 98 percent acceptance rating, blowing away the common CEO approval score of 67 percent. (The ranking is founded on voluntary, anonymous submissions on Glassdoor.)

"FOCUS ON SIGNAL OVER NOISE. DON'T SPEND YOUR TIME ON STUFF THAT DOESN'T MAKE THINGS BETTER."

As Musk schedules the others of his evening, he must relentlessly prioritize. And that is his productivity recommendation for others, too.

"Concentrate on signal over noises. Don't spend your time on items that doesn't actually make issues better," he says.

For Musk the "transmission" is product development, to which he dedicates the majority of his attention, according to an interview with Y Combinator president, Sam Altman.

"I think a lot of people are convinced I must spend lots of time with press or on businessy factors," says Musk. "But basically almost all my time, like 80 percent of it, is allocated to engineering and style. Engineering and style, so it is developing next-generation merchandise. That's 80 percent of it."

In his free time, Musk says he likes to watch movies, hang out with friends and enjoy first-person shooters along with his kids. ("First-person shooters" are a type of gaming where the player sees through the perspective of the key personality and fires weapons.)

He's also been recognized to attend (and throw) "occasional crazy parties," he says. And he's a fan of the annual Burning Man event in the Nevada desert.

As they say, work hard, take up hard.
